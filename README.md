# A PyTorch Tutorial
I created this for some of my lab-mates at NYU Tandon. PyTorch is wonderfully intuitive once you get going with it.

This is a basic (functional) skeleton code that you can (hopefully) modify for (REPEATABLE) research purposes.

Later I may add some more instructions /explanations here. Just check out the `train_demo.py` file for a hands-on example and don't skim over the comments...!

# TO-DO's:
1. give an example of loading ddict and plotting results
2. provide a bash script for hyperparameter testing
3. provide a bash script for cross-validation
